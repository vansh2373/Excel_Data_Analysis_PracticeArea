Cleaning Steps
First I checked and removed Duplicates from all the data 
Secondly I fixed the gender Column By Converting all the Genders into proper Form
Then I Handled the missing Values which was there in Text columns so I Replaced Blanks with Unknown tag
After that I added two new column one is Total Scores and the other one is Average scores
Finally I applied conditional formating for filling the scores less than 40 with red color and greater than or equal to 90 with green color
